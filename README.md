> Archive of my OpenPGP public keys.

This is an archive of the many, many OpenPGP keys I have had in my life. For
more information, see
[my latest transition statement](https://gist.github.com/kytta/a08dd3656c302c59e0fcf8d567f86cb2).

Please note, that this repo **does not** include my current primary key. You 
can get the latest version from the OpenPGP keyserver:
[`0xF0A49E6D84E6EEBE`](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/D83649109830AF99BD41C9D2F0A49E6D84E6EEBE)

Alternatively, use `gpg` on the command line:

```sh
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 0xF0A49E6D84E6EEBE
```
